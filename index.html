      <article id="Etymology">
        <h3>Etimology</h3>
        <p>
          Yogyakarta is named after the Indian city of Ayodhya, the birthplace
          of the eponymous hero Rama from the Ramayana epic. Yogya means
          "suitable; fit; proper", and karta means "prosperous; flourishing".
          Thus, Yogyakarta means "[a city that is] fit to prosper". In colonial
          era correspondence, the city is often written in the Javanese script
          as ꦔꦪꦺꦴꦒꦾꦏꦂꦠ, read as /ˌŋɑːjɒɡjəˈkɑːrtə/ with the added prefix nga-.
          In the orthography of the time, the proper name was spelt with the
          Latin alphabet as "Jogjakarta". As the orthography of the Indonesian
          language changed, the consonant /j/ came to be written with (y), and
          the consonant /dʒ/ with (j). Personal and geographical names however,
          were allowed to maintain their original spelling according to
          contemporary Indonesian orthography. Thus, the city can be written as
          "Yogyakarta", which is true to its original pronunciation and the
          Javanese script spelling, or "Jogjakarta", which is true to the old
          Dutch spelling and reflects popular pronunciation today, but differs
          from the original Ayodhya etymology. One may encounter either
          "Yogyakarta" or "Jogjakarta" in contemporary documents.

        <div class="history">
          <h4>Mataram Kingdom (8th–10th century CE)</h4>
          <p>
            According to the Canggal inscription dated 732 CE, the area
            traditionally known as "Mataram" became the capital of the Medang
            Kingdom, identified as Mdang i Bhumi Mataram established by King
            Sanjaya of Mataram. The inscription was found in a Hindu temple in
            Central Java, 40 km away from Yogyakarta and 20 km away from the
            giant Borobudur temple complex. This Hindu temple itself was on the
            border between the area of the Hindu Sañjaya dynasty and the area of
            the Buddhist Shailendra dynasty. Mataram became the centre of a
            refined and sophisticated Javanese Hindu-Buddhist culture for about
            three centuries in the heartland of the Progo River valley, on the
            southern slopes of Mount Merapi volcano. This time period witnessed
            the construction of numerous candi, including Borobudur and
            Prambanan. Around the year 929 CE, the last ruler of the Sañjaya
            dynasty, King Mpu Sindok of Mataram, moved the seat of power of the
            Mataram Kingdom from Central Java to East Java and thus established
            the Isyana dynasty. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain;
            however, a severe eruption from Mount Merapi or a power struggle
            with the Sumatra-based Srivijaya kingdom probably caused the move.
            Historians suggest that some time during the reign of King Wawa of
            Mataram (924–929 CE), Merapi erupted and devastated the kingdom's
            capital in Mataram.

        <div class="history">
          <h4>Majapahit Empire (1293–1527)</h4>
          <p>
            During the Majapahit era, the area surrounding modern Yogyakarta was
            identified again as "Mataram" and recognised as one of the twelve
            Majapahit provinces in Java ruled by a Duke known as Bhre Mataram.
            During the reign of the fourth king of the Majapahit Empire, the
            Hindu King Hayam Wuruk (1350–1389) of the Rajasa dynasty, the title
            of Bhre Mataram was held by the king's nephew and son-in-law
            Wikramawardhana, later the fifth king of Majapahit.

          <h4>Mataram Sultanate (1587–1755)</h4>
          <p>
            Kotagede, now a district in southeastern Yogyakarta, was established
            as the capital of the Mataram Sultanate from 1587 to 1613. During
            the reign of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo (1613–1645), the Mataram
            Sultanate reached its zenith as the greatest kingdom in Java, and
            expanded its influence to Central Java, East Java, and half of West
            Java. After two changes of capital—to Karta and then to Plered, both
            located in present-day Bantul Regency—the capital of the Mataram
            Sultanate finally moved to Kartasura.

        <div class="history">
          <h4>Yogyakarta secedes and European invasions (1745–1830)</h4>
          <p>
            A civil war in the Mataram Sultanate broke out between Pakubuwono II
            (1745–1749), the last ruler of Kartasura, and his younger brother
            and heir apparent to the throne, Prince Mangkubumi (later known as
            Hamengkubuwono I, the first Sultan of Yogyakarta, and the founder of
            the current ruling royal house). Pakubuwono II had agreed to
            cooperate with the Dutch East India Company, and ceded some Mataram
            territory to the Dutch. His younger brother, Prince Mangkubumi,
            stood against the agreement, citing concerns that the people would
            become slaves under Dutch rule. During the war, Prince Mangkubumi
            defeated Pakubuwono II's forces and declared sovereignty in the
            Sultanate of Yogyakarta, occupying the southern parts of the former
            Mataram Sultanate. With Pakubowono II dead from illness, the
            Yogyakarta Sultanate was established as a result of the Treaty of
            Giyanti (Perjanjian Gianti), signed and ratified on 13 February 1755
            among Prince Mangkubumi, the Dutch East India Company, and his
            nephew Pakubuwono III and his allies. Ascending to the newly created
            Yogyakarta throne with the name Sultan Hamengkubuwono I, Mangkubumi
            thus established the royal House of Hamengkubuwono, still the ruling
            house of Yogyakarta today. Sultan Hamengkubuwono I and his family
            officially moved into the Palace of Yogyakarta, still the seat of
            the reigning sultan, on 7 October 1756. These events consequently
            marked the end of the Mataram Sultanate, resulting in the births of
            the rival Yogyakarta Sultanate and the Surakarta Sunanate. During
            the brief period British rule over Java in 1811, rumours of plans by
            the Yogyakarta court to launch an attack against the British led to
            uneasiness among the Britons stationed in Java. On 20 June 1812, Sir
            Stamford Raffles led a 1,200-strong British force to capture the
            Yogyakarta kraton. The Yogyakarta forces, surprised by the attack,
            were easily defeated; the kraton fell in one day, and was
            subsequently sacked and burnt. The attack on the kraton was the
            first of its kind in Indonesian history, leaving the Yogyakarta
            court humiliated. The sultanate found itself involved in conflict
            again during the Java War.]

        <div class="history">
          <h4>Republic of Indonesia era (1945–present)</h4>
          <p>
            In 1942, the Japanese Empire invaded the Dutch East Indies and ruled
            Java until they were defeated in 1945. Sukarno proclaimed the
            independence of the Indonesian Republic on 17 August 1945; Sultan
            Hamengkubuwono IX promptly sent a letter to Sukarno, expressing his
            support for the newly born nation of Indonesia and acknowledging the
            Yogyakarta Sultanate as part of the Indonesian Republic. The
            Sultanate of Surakarta did the same, and both of the Javanese
            kingdoms were accordingly awarded privileged statuses as "Special
            Regions" within the Indonesian Republic. However, because of a
            leftist anti-royalist uprising in Surakarta, the Sunanate of
            Surakarta lost its special administrative status in 1946 and was
            absorbed into Central Java Province. Yogyakarta's support was
            essential in the Indonesian struggle for independence during the
            Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949). The city of Yogyakarta
            became the capital of the Indonesian Republic from 1946 to 1948,
            after the fall of Jakarta to the Dutch. Later the Dutch also invaded
            Yogyakarta, causing the Republic's capital to be transferred once
            again, to Bukittinggi in West Sumatra on 19 December 1948. The
            General Offensive of 1 March 1949 resulted in an Indonesian
            political and strategic victory against the Dutch and the withdrawal
            of Dutch forces from Yogyakarta. On 29 June 1949 Yogyakarta was
            completely cleared of Dutch forces, under pressure from the United
            Nations. Because of its significant contribution to the survival of
            the Indonesian Republic, Yogyakarta was given autonomy as a "special
            district", making it the only region headed by a recognised monarchy
            in Indonesia.

        <h3>Geography</h3>
        <p>
          The area of the city of Yogyakarta is 32.5 square kilometres (12.5
          square miles). While the city spreads in all directions from the
          Kraton, the Sultan's palace, the core of the modern city is to the
          north, centred around Dutch colonial-era buildings and the commercial
          district. Jalan Malioboro, with rows of pavement vendors and nearby
          markets and malls, is the primary shopping street for tourists in the
          city, while Jalan Solo, further north and east, is the shopping
          district more frequented by locals. The large local market of
          Beringharjo (id) and the restored Dutch fort of Vredeburg are on the
          eastern part of the southern end of Malioboro. Surrounding the Kraton
          is a densely populated residential neighbourhood that occupies land
          that was formerly the Sultan's sole domain. Evidence of this former
          use remains in the form of old walls, scattered throughout the city,
          and the ruins of the Taman Sari water castle, built in 1758 as a
          pleasure garden. No longer in use by the Sultan, the garden was
          largely abandoned before being used for housing by palace employees
          and descendants. Reconstruction efforts began in 2004, and the site is
          now a popular tourist attraction. Nearby to the city of Yogyakarta is
          Mount Merapi, with the northern outskirts of the city running up to
          the southern slopes of the mountain in Sleman Regency. Mount Merapi
          (literally "mountain of fire" in both Indonesian and Javanese), is an
          active stratovolcano located on the border between Central Java and
          Yogyakarta. It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted
          regularly since 1548, with the last eruption occurring in May 2018.

        <h3>Tourism</h3>
        <p>
          Yogyakarta is home to a myriad of heritage buildings, landmarks and
          important monuments. Because of its proximity to the Borobudur and
          Prambanan temples, and presence of the Javanese court Kraton culture
          of Kraton Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta hosts a sizeable tourist industry.
          Kotagede, the capital of Mataram Sultanate is also located in the
          city. Many tourists come to Yogyakarta as an accommodation base to
          visit Borobudur and Prambanan. Malioboro street is a popular shopping
          and culinary area within the city, which has pedestrian zone.[26]
          Yogyakarta Kraton is the palace and seat of the reigning Sultan of
          Yogyakarta also located in the city. The palace complex is a centre of
          Javanese culture, and contains a museum displaying royal artefacts.
          Tugu monument is an important landmark of Yogyakarta. 1 March monument
          located on Jalan Malioboro was built to commemorate General Offensive
          of 1 March 1949 during the Indonesian National Revolution.

              (hard boiled egg stew), and krechek (spicy beef skin and tofu
              stew). Gudeg from Yogyakarta has a unique sweet and savoury taste,
              and is drier and more reddish than other regional variants because

            Yogyakarta has several historical sites, such as the Candi Prambanan
            temple, museums in the royal court, the Sonobudoyo Museum, and
            museums in colonial buildings such as the Fort Vredeburg Museum
            housed in a former Dutch fort. Due to the importance of Yogyakarta
            during the war of independence from the Dutch, there are numerous
            memorials and museums, such as the Monument to the Recapture of
            Yogyakarta. To the east of the town centre is the large Air Force
            Museum (Museum Pusat Dirgantara Mandala), with 36 aircraft in the
            building and six aircraft displayed outdoors. As Indonesia was for a
            period in the Soviet sphere of influence, this museum contains a
            number of vintage Russian aircraft not widely available for
            inspection in the NATO sphere of influence. The collection includes
            examples of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 trainer, Mikoyan-Gurevich
            MiG-17, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 and Tupolev
            Tu-16, together with an assortment of Japanese, American and British
            aircraft. Other museums include the Jogja National Museum.
